# Applied-Electronics-Repeat-the-Color

"Repeat the Colors" is a game similar to "Simon" (not to be confused with "Simon Says"), invented in 1978 and popular in the 1980s. In the original memory game, "Simon" generates a sequence of tones and lights that the player must repeat. If successful, the sequence becomes longer and more complex. The game resets when the player makes a mistake or runs out of time.

In the same style, "Repeat the Colors" uses four RGB LEDs of different colors, four push-buttons, and an additional green LED. A microcontroller generates a sequence of random numbers, which correspond to the lighting of the LEDs. The player must press the buttons in the same order the LEDs light up. Each correct press extends the sequence, making it more complex. The current score is displayed on an LCD screen and updated after each round.

The game's difficulty can be adjusted using a DIP switch, which controls the speed at which the LEDs light up and the time allowed between button presses. The project involves designing the electrical schematic, circuit board, flowchart, and coding using the Arduino IDE.
